## Help

### What if I can't right-click?

Try holding Shift while you right-click, Firefox will make sure web site does not prevent context menu from opening this way.

### What do I do with copied m3u links?

This addon will not download them, but you can use [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to download them or players like mpv / vlc to play them.

## Building
