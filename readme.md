## Help

### What do I do with copied m3u links?

This addon will not download them, but you can use [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) to download them or players like mpv / vlc to play them.

## Building

First run `yarn` to install dependencies.

### Development

In one terminal run `yarn watch`, in another terminal run `yarn dev`.

### Production

`yarn build`
